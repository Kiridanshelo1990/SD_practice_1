# SD_practice_1
SD class task

This repo contains files about 'distributed systems' class from our university. 
We are trying to make a simple and didactic version of a Torrent system which 
contains a 'Tracker' object and non-defined number of 'Peers' object.

The comunication between the peers will be based in Gossip protocol.
